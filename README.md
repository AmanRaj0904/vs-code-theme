# Dark-Blur-Theme README


Here is the VS Code theme that I use. I like dark themes so it's dark :)

I took inspiration from the Community Material and the Dark+ Material themes.

💥 If you like this theme and would like to support me on GitHub!

Will be maintaining this as I have time, thanks for your understanding! 🙏🏽
